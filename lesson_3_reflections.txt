When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You would want to create a remote repository when you want to share and collaborate on a project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because it could potentially pull the changes made by other contributors and erasing my work in progress that I had not push to the remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork would be a copy of an existing repository to your own repository. Useful to customize other existing projects.
A clone would be making a copy to your local environment, in order to contribute to the project.
A branch is like an experimental repo that separates from the original until it is ready to merge.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You can catch conflicting code before it is pushed into the remote repository.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Without using Git GitHub, collaborating on one piece of work would be in the same computer to avoid conflicting work. Communication/Understanding would be easier but finding time to work together and piecing it together would be much more difficult.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

Separate branch is prefereable when working on extra features or experimental versions.
