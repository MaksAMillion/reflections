When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You would want to create a remote repository when you want to share and collaborate on a project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because it could potentially pull the changes made by other contributors and erasing my work in progress that I had not push to the remote repository.
