When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You would want to create a remote repository when you want to share and collaborate on a project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because it could potentially pull the changes made by other contributors and erasing my work in progress that I had not push to the remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork would be a copy of an existing repository to your own repository. Useful to customize other existing projects.
A clone would be making a copy to your local environment, in order to contribute to the project.
A branch is like an experimental repo that separates from the original until it is ready to merge.
