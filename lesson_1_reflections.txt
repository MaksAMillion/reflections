How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file 
help you see the bug that was introduced?

It showed me the scope of the change and allowed 
me to see my mistakes.

How could having easy acces to the entire history of 
a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long
term?

I would be able to go to a previous version if I 
chose that did not liek new iterations of the program.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing
when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having 
versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros can include having the history orgranized by logic fixes. 
COns cna include forgetting to commit.
