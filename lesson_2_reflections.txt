What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
a file called .git is created to notify that it is a git repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area lets you prepare what you want to send to the repository and the working directory is all the work that you have not put in the repository to be combined.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
use git diff between the files in the staging area
